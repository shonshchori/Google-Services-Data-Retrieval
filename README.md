# Google Services Data Retrieval
This assignment is part of a course on Advanced Data Mining and Analysis in Python and requires us to retrieve information about a list of destinations from the Google API Distance Matrix and Geocode Dervices.
The goal is to retrieve the distance, time, longitude, and latitude of each destination in relation to Tel Aviv, and then store the data in a structured format using a dataframe.
